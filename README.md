This project is largely a collection of helpful screenshots that constitute guides on how to shoot under par on courses in [Golf With Your Friends](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431240/). It also will contain a method of generating webpages from the screenshots for easy navigation during gameplay.

(Note to the extra curious: `javac *.java && java WebBuilder`)
